# Scarpet syntax highlighting for Atom

## Installation

Download this repository as a `.zip` file, and unzip it to the Atom package location

Windows: `C:\Users\YOUR USER NAME\.atom\packages`

Now restart Atom, and any file with `.sc` or `.scl` will open with Scarpet syntax highlighting by default!
